# ABACUS Project Repository

Welcome to the ABACUS team repo! 🎉

This is where we’re keeping **everything** for our semester-long Android app project:  

- Code for the app (once we know what it is 😉)  
- Notes, meeting summaries, and project plans  
- Design mockups and wireframes  
- Resources, tutorials, and helpful links  
- Templates for PRs, issues, and CI workflows  

Right now, this repo gives us a **clean, organized place** to start working together and keep all our stuff in one spot.
